# Advent of Code in Rust
Created in preparation for Advent of Code 2024. The following will be the personal rules/themes I plan to use when Dec 1, 2024 hits:
* Use of AI is HIGHLY encouraged (see `Why AI?` below)
* Primary focuses are:
  - Complete the problems quickly - don't worry about making it perfect or more performant (unless the problem runs very slowly)
  - Heavy testing - wanting to go fast AND make heavy use of AI means there will be lots of opportunities to break things. Good testing will help detect breaking changes faster, keeping the feedback loop small and fast.

# Why AI?
For 2024 I will be HEAVILY relying on AI to make things go faster. In the past I have focused plenty on trying to get the most out of doing each problem, but this comes at a lot of costs:
* Time - everything takes longer
* Focus/motivation - dragging out problems makes it harder to stay interested enough to keep going on this spare-time task that one doesn't *have* to complete
* Same old paths - years of doing various coding problems will have created muscle memory for various common tasks. This is good for moving fast, but bad for considering new and different ways of solving something.
* Putting the problem and solution into words - it cannot be understated how incredibly valuable it is to put a problem you are thinking about into words, and the same goes for the solution to the problem. See "[Rubber Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)" for more info.
  - The path I prefer so far for writing Rust via AI is to build out a rough set of types that should guide how to solve the problem, and then tell the AI tool what the implementation should look like. When the AI is having a hard time creating the implementation then it is time to break down the tasks into smaller chunks and guide it accordingly.
